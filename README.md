# Vlad Oancea's Assignment

## Project Summary:
A real-time 3D PBR render engine, able to interactively load and position meshes through an interface, assign them materials and display them using multiple types of lights or HDR environment maps and custom backgrounds.
The program would then allow you to save the resulted image.
This could have the practical use of having a tool to quickly showcase models and textures, for either lookdev or personal projects, similar to Marmoset Toolbag, but in real-time.
Stretch goals:
- post processing effects (AO, color correction, vignette etc)
- support for rig-based animated meshes
- a slightly more robust shader editor that allows you to do more than just assign the textures to the pre-made material type
